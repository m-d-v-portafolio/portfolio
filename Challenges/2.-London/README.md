Original project from datalab (Datacamp).

 - What is DataCamp?
   Learn the data and AI skills you need online at your own paceâ€”from non-coding essentials to data science, AI, and machine learning.

[Datacamp website](https://app.datacamp.com/)

This is a particular project because it uses SQL tables that I was not able to download so I was only able to run and test this project on the Datacamp environment but I pasted the SQL queries that solve all the questions.

 I have now made my DataCamp portafolio public so by following the below link you should be able to see the web version of the project instead of having to download the notebooks.
