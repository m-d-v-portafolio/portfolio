# Portafolio

This portafolio contains sample __Projects__ and __Challenges__ that I have created.

 - Projects are end-to-end examples I found and follow on the internet so basically me following a video or post.
 - Challenges are real0-world-scenarios that I also found on the internet but they are different from projects as there was no 'guide' or video to follow. Just a set of instructions, datasets and a goal, inside them you will find my apporach to solving them.

Inside every project and challenge I have created a file that will contain all prerequesits in order to run project or challeng locally as well as reference of where did I get the idea from.
